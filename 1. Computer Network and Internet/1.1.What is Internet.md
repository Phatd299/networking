## Internet Description 1

End systems access the Internet through Internet Service Providers (ISPs)

The Internet is all about connecting end systems to each other, so the ISPs that provide access to end systems must also be interconnected. 

These **lower-tier** ISPs are thus interconnected through national and international upper-tier ISPs and these **upper-tier** ISPs are connected directly to each other. An upper-tier ISP consists of high-speed routers interconnected with high-speed fiber-optic links.

## Internet Description 2

An  infrastructure that provides services to applications. 

The applications are said to be **distributed applications**, since they involve multiple end systems that exchange data with each other.

## What is a protocol?

All activity in the Internet that involves two or more communicating remote entities is governed by a protocol.

```
A protocol defines the **format** and the **order** of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.
```
